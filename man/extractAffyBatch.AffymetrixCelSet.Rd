\title{Extracts an in-memory AffyBatch object from the CEL set}

\description{
 Extracts an in-memory AffyBatch object from the CEL set.
 Note that any modifications done to the extract object will \emph{not}
 be reflected in the original CEL set.
}

\usage{
\method{extractAffyBatch}{AffymetrixCelSet}(this, ..., verbose=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{...}{Argument passed to \code{ReadAffy()}
    (\code{\link[affy]{read.affybatch}}).}
  \item{verbose}{See \code{\link[R.utils]{Verbose}}.}
}

\value{
 Returns an \code{\link[affy]{AffyBatch-class}} object.
}

\details{
 Since the \pkg{affy} package is making use of special CDF environment
 packages, this method will warn if the needed package is missing and
 explain that \pkg{affy} will later try to download and install it
 automatically.
